# clau

Run Claude Code (or other AI CLIs) inside a Docker container. Per-project firewall, persistent auth, persistent shell history, and a shared pip volume so AI-installed Python packages survive across sessions.

## Install

```bash
./install.sh        # builds the image, symlinks `clau` and `clau-login` into ~/.local/bin
clau-login          # one-time OAuth login (stored in the `claude-auth` Docker volume)
```

## Run

```bash
cd ~/path/to/project
clau                # default: firewall ON, allowlist from ./allowlist.txt
clau --yolo         # adds --dangerously-skip-permissions
clau --no-firewall  # debug mode
```

## Secrets / API keys / credentials

Two ways to inject env vars into the container. Both are loaded with `--env-file`, so the AI sees them as normal environment variables.

### 1. Per-project secrets (recommended for keys you don't want in the project repo)

Drop a `.env` file at `secrets/<project-name>.env` inside the clau install dir. `<project-name>` is the lowercased basename of your project directory. Example:

```bash
# project at ~/work/my-app  →  project-name = "my-app"
cat > /path/to/clau/secrets/my-app.env <<EOF
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
EOF
```

This directory is gitignored (see `.gitignore`).

### 2. Project `.env` (loaded if present in the project root)

If your project already has a `.env`, clau auto-mounts it. Make sure it's gitignored in the project itself.

Both files are loaded if both exist; project `.env` wins on conflicting keys.

### Credential files (not just env vars)

For things like `gcloud` credentials JSON or SSH keys, mount them as files. Easiest path: keep them inside the project at a gitignored path and reference them by path from a `.env`:

```env
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/workspace/.secrets/gcp.json
```

Then put the JSON inside your project at `.secrets/gcp.json` (gitignored) — it's available at `/workspace/.secrets/gcp.json` inside the container.

## Telling the AI to USE a secret without reading its value

The AI should reference the variable **by name** in code, never `cat` / `printenv` / `echo $VAR` to inspect the value. Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Secrets

The following env vars are available inside the container. Use them by name in code (e.g. `os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`). DO NOT print, log, echo, or cat them — treat the values as opaque.

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — OpenAI API key
- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` — path to GCP service account JSON
```

That tells Claude (1) what's available, (2) the exact variable names to use, and (3) not to leak the values into the chat or logs.

## Python packages persist

`pip install <anything>` inside the container goes into the shared `clau-pip` Docker volume (mounted at `/home/dev/.pip-user`). Packages survive container restarts and are shared across all projects.

To wipe and start fresh:

```bash
docker volume rm clau-pip
```

## Adding tools later (Headroom, Caveman, etc.)

A shared `clau-tools` volume is mounted at `/opt/clau-tools` and on `PATH`. Install once, available in every project, no rebuild needed.

```bash
clau                                                # enter container
curl -fsSL https://example.com/install.sh \
  | PREFIX=/opt/clau-tools bash                     # install into the volume
which headroom                                      # /opt/clau-tools/bin/headroom

# remove a single tool
rm -rf /opt/clau-tools/bin/headroom /opt/clau-tools/share/headroom

# nuclear: wipe all tools
docker volume rm clau-tools
```

Once a tool is proven, "promote" it by adding the install command to the `Dockerfile` and rebuilding.

## Defense-in-depth: secrets guard

Two layers run inside every `clau` container to catch obvious secret-reading attempts:

**Layer 1 — `permissions.deny`** in `claude-settings.json`. Pattern-blocks Claude Code tool calls like `Read(/root/**)`, `Bash(printenv)`, `Bash(env)`, `Bash(cat:/run/secrets/**)`, etc.

**Layer 2 — `PreToolUse` hook** at `hooks/secrets-guard.py`. Inspects every Bash/Read/Write/Edit call, blocks patterns like `cat /root/...`, dynamic DNS lookups (`nslookup $X`), POSTing env vars to external hosts, writing PEM blocks to disk. Logs all blocks to `/var/log/clau/secrets-guard.log` (root-owned, AI cannot read).

To tune the rules, edit `hooks/secrets-guard.py` (host side); changes take effect on next `clau` start. To disable temporarily for debugging, comment out the `hooks` block in `claude-settings.json`.

**Important**: this is *defense-in-depth*, not primary security. A determined AI can bypass these (encode the secret, use indirection, write a script). The real boundaries are: (1) sidecar broker so long-lived creds never enter the container, (2) firewall allowlist so exfil paths are blocked. The hook + deny rules raise the bar against accidental leaks and shallow attempts.

## Firewall allowlist

- Default: `allowlist.txt` (clau install root)
- Per-project override: `allowlists/<project-name>.txt`

One domain per line. The container can only reach hosts on the allowlist (plus DNS).

## Volumes

| Volume | Purpose | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-auth` | Claude OAuth session | global |
| `clau-pip` | pip-installed Python packages | global, all projects |
| `clau-tools` | dev tools (Headroom, Caveman, ...) | global, all projects |
| `clau-history-<project>` | bash history | per-project |
